Challenge07 Rubric:

10pts - Watch intro videos for Google NPL API
5pts - Watch intro videos for Tweepy API
10pts - Set up and start twitter developer account 
15pts - Writing script to connect to twitter and scrape tweets from trending tags

Hour Log:


Report:
1.5 hrs Planning project with group
1.0 hrs Watching Sentdex Google API intro videos
1.0 hrs Researched and installed twitter apis
3.0 hrs Wrote python connection to twitter, learned how the data returned way srtuctures, parsed, and saved said data

Total: 6.5 hrs

The challenge went well, it was interesting learning how to connect to different APIs. Figuring out how to setup our structure and 
python enviornment was also interested.
