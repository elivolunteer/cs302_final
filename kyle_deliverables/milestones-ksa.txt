Milestones for challenge 7:

1. Learn how to use and run python within VSCode
2. Watch basic python tutorials to learn the basics of the language, "Hello World"
3. Create a python file to connect to the github repo
4. Recreate a past challenge/lab using python instead of C++
5. Push to github, make sure other team members can see/use
6. Watch googlecloud platform videos 

Rubric:
5pts - setting up python in vscode

Mon	10/18	3hrs		completed setting up python in vscode, watching basic videos, hello world and basic code, worked on rewriting project1 into python
Thu 10/21   1hr         Got input file parsed correctly for proj1 rewrite, figured out how classes work and started implementation   
Thu 10/21   2hrs        Set up maps (dictionaries), correctly loaded data into maps and classes, printed it to user. Still need to get it ordered/sorted

How challenge 7 went:
I thought this challenge went really well. I have been enjoying taking time to learn python and apply it to old labs. The only problem I had with it was trying to balance the time with this with the time spent on project 4.
