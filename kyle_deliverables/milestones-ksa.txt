2. Watch basic python tutorials to learn the basics of the language, "Hello World"
3. Create a python file to connect to the github repo
4. Recreate a past challenge/lab using python instead of C++
5. Push to github, make sure other team members can see/use
6. Watch googlecloud platform videos 

Rubric:
5pts - setting up python in vscode
5pts - watching python videos and creating a "hello world" file that works
5pts - setting up a python file with github
15pts - rewriting a past lab with python, works properly, github push/pull
10pts - watch google cloud videos

Wed 11/10   4hrs        learn about the google API and sentiment analysis, trying to determine if analyzing a single word is possible. Ended up trying to implement Entity sentiment analysis
Mon 11/22   2hrs        Worked on setting up "analyze.py" to get it to run our analysis against googles for an inputted text. Having trouble with pickle
Sun 11/28   0.5hrs      Got random forest and google sentiment printing in analyze.py

How challenge 7 went:
I thought this challenge went really well. I have been enjoying taking time to learn python and apply it to old labs. The only problem I had with it was trying to balance the time with this with the time spent on project 4.
